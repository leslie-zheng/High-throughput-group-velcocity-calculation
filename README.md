Supplementary Data

The attached file contains the mp_id, transverse and longitudinal group velocities, and the number of sites in the primitive cell for all materials included in our screening. All data were generated using the MACE machine-learning interatomic potential.

Note that the sound of speed can be evaluated by equation from the following literatures: 
O. L. Anderson, J. Phys. Chem. Solids 24, 909 (1963).
L. E. Kinsler, A. R. Frey, and J. V. Sanders, Fundamentals of Acoustics (Wiley, New York, 2000).
Jia, T., Chen, G., & Zhang, Y. (2017). Lattice thermal conductivity evaluated using elastic properties. Physical Review B, 95(15), 155206.

These data were used solely for screening materials with ultralow lattice thermal conductivity. Note that several extremely large values (in sound velocities or predicted κ) arise from controlable instabilities and numerical noise in the current MACE model. These outliers do not affect the effectiveness or reliability of our universal descriptor for lattice thermal conductivity, which depends only on coarse phonon features. Importantly, this unstability of current MACE model also did not affect the materials screening process for ultra-low thernal condcutivity in our work.  

This dataset supports the findings presented in the following manuscript:
